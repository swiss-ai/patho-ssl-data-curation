## UMAP interactive Visualizer
This was built using [Marimo](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo) and is based on the following work [Histomorphological Phenotype Learning](https://github.com/AdalbertoCq/Histomorphological-Phenotype-Learning/tree/master)

Please make sure you have all slides and respective tiles available, either as an h5 file or using openslide. The slide ids and tiles `(x,y)` coordinates are specified in [umap_metadata.csv](visualization_tool/umap_metadata.csv), tiles are of size `224px X 224px` at 20x magnification or 0.5 um/px.

1. You can edit the code by running `marimo edit tile_visualizer_umap.py`. Run the app with `marimo run tile_visualizer_umap.py`. 
2. Now you should be able to access the marimo app via [http://localhost:2718](http://localhost:2718/)
